                I'm a recent graduate from the University of Maryland with a
                Bachelor of Science in Information Science, specialized in Python
                and data science. My journey in software engineering has been
                shaped by hands-on experience through internships at FrontLine
                Insurance and Cognitive GeoInterpretation Inc., where I've worked
                on full-stack applications and machine learning projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm passionate about machine learning and AI projects, with
                experience using technologies like scikit-learn, XGBoost, and
                OpenCV. I've built projects ranging from real-time ASL recognition
                systems to data analysis tools, always eager to apply cutting-edge
                technologies to solve real-world problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a new graduate, I'm excited to gain more experience in the
                software engineering space. I'm particularly interested in
                opportunities that allow me to work with machine learning,
                data science, and AI technologies while continuing to grow as a
                developer.
